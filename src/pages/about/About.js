                Law is one of the most important elements that transform humans
                from mere beasts into intelligent and special beings. Law tells
                us what is right and wrong and how we, humans, should act to
                achieve a peaceful society while enjoying individual freedoms.
                The key to a successful nation is a firm, strong, and fair code
                of high laws that provides equal and just freedom to all
                citizens of the country. Our mission is to make the law
                accessible and understandable for everyone. Advocate solution
                contains a wealth of free, up-to-date, and easily understandable
                legal information and tools. When all we really want is merely
                stuff that works, technology is all we have. There is an urgent
                need to embrace and understand the power of technology given the
                present paradigm change in the technical industry. Employing a
                fresh approach that makes hiring professionals simple as well as
                nonetheless on guard to meet the challenges of change. A
                platform for hiring professional must be created as a result.
                The platform searches for available advocates and consultants to
                hire beyond localities. Advocates/Consultants and clients form
                the foundation of the advocate solution. Updates on the services
                specifics and rent are given by the advocates. Information is
                provided to the clients. The Advocate Solution is the greatest
                option for clients as well as advocates since it saves time,
                only involves one eligible party, and eliminates the need to
                describe the service specifics face to face. We offer the most
                comprehensive lawyer directory on the internet. We help connect
                people with legal issues to the right professionals who are

                the best and most suitable lawyer within a single platform with
                a very user-friendly and simply accessible system. Many
                countries around the world have implemented the concept in
                various ways, but no such platform has been developed yet in
                Bangladesh.

                Why Advocate Solutions?

              <p className=" text-sm text-justify font-mono py-3">
                Laws protect our general safety and ensure our rights as
                citizens against abuses by other people, organizations, and by
                the government itself. We have laws to help provide for our
                general safety. These exist at the state, and national levels.
                So people need to be facilitated with a system for finding the
                right professionals and understandable legal information & tools
                which should be convenient, instantaneous, and less time-
                consuming. But these kinds of facilities are absent in the
                traditional system. In a country like Bangladesh, various
                drawbacks of the existing system cause much inertness and
                complexity. Besides, a very crucial fact is that underprivileged
                people are facing extensive difficulties in real life. Most of
                the time, they can't file any lawsuit against abuse because of
                lacking proper knowledge of the law. As a result, they had to go
                through various procedures physically in court and in the
                lawyer's office.
